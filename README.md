#Ohio Five Digital Scholarship site
These are the code snippets used to customize the <a href="http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/">Ohio Five digital scholarship site</a>. The site is a wordpress site run on a bootstrap-informed theme called <a href="http://presscustomizr.com/customizr/" target=_blank>customizr</a>. I wanted pages that would display in certain ways and have certain behaviors; because I'm not a wordpress developer I just used the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/" target=_blank>bootstrap design features</a> that are baked into the theme to create the pages that I wanted. By composing in an external text editor and then pasting my code into the "text" interface for Wordpress pages/posts (as opposed to the WYSIWYG), I was able to make(e.g.) a page that shows all of the schools' projects in a descriptive gallery format. 

Maybe there are themes out there that do this, or plugins, but who has time to look through them all? This was more fun anyway, and let me familiarize muyself a little more with bootstrap.
