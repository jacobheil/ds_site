# Ohio Five Digital Scholarship site

Many of the files in this repo are just drafts of blog posts that are going onto [the OH5DS blog](http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/blog/). I'm writing using [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) that I then [transformed to HTML](http://dillinger.io/) to paste them into the Wordpress interface. As I mention below with my code snippets for the DS site, this is a multi-step process that is probably more labor-intesive than it needs to be. Indeed, Wordpress is designed so that we can compose drafts and di everything from the WYSIWYG. But this process allows me to practice:
* drafting in a [text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* drafting using markdown, versions of which are used by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and (obv) [GitHub](https://octodex.github.com/)
* version controlling my drafts [using git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) in [the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
* writing in public by [pushing](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) to GitHub

Some files here are the code snippets used to customize the <a href="http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/">Ohio Five digital scholarship site</a>. The site is a wordpress site run on a bootstrap-informed theme called <a href="http://presscustomizr.com/customizr/" target=_blank>customizr</a>. I wanted pages that would display in certain ways and have certain behaviors; because I'm not a wordpress developer I just used the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/" target=_blank>bootstrap design features</a> that are baked into the theme to create the pages that I wanted. By composing in an external text editor and then pasting my code into the "text" interface for Wordpress pages/posts (as opposed to the WYSIWYG), I was able to make(e.g.) a page that shows all of the schools' projects in a descriptive gallery format. Maybe there are themes out there that do this, or plugins, but who has time to look through them all? This was more fun anyway, and let me familiarize muyself a little more with bootstrap.
