## What is DS and What's it doing in the Library?

Inspired by David Eastman's question: why has it settled in the library?
Re-read Kirschenbaum, analyze whether or not this is true. Ask Paul Dilley if he thinks this is true; he has a project (Big Ancient Mediterranean) that is designed to be a data archive for orphaned datasets/projects. Or at least it'll link them. Do some argue that libraries are *not* the way to go? That it's up to individuals or disciplinary groups to shepherd their own data? 

This might also be a good theme for the Ohio Five Libraries' Summer Institute.
