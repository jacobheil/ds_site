<p>Earlier this month I attended the second of four exhibit launches for Kenyon professor Clara Román-Odio’s public humanities project, <em>Latinos in Rural America</em> <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/middle-path/story/documenting-culture/">(LiRA)</a>. The <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/exhibit-information/">material exhibit</a>, currently in the Mt. Vernon Public Library, also has <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/">a digital component</a> that is held in Kenyon’s digital repository. As we read in the brief introduction to the project’s digital component,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project pursues the goal of providing an intimate window into the lives, origins and aspirations of Latinos in Knox County, home to Kenyon College.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exhibit in Mt. Vernon follows the project’s initial unveiling in December at Kenyon College and will be succeeded by exhibits at the Ohio State University (9 - 23 February) and Miami of Ohio (30 March - 12 April).</p>
<p>Román-Odio has folded LiRA into her <em>Introduction to Chicano/a Cultural Studies</em> as a platform for exemplifying the ways in which community-engaged learning (CEL) strengthens undergraduate research and civic engagement. You can <a href="http://digital.kenyon.edu/lkacundergrad/">read more</a> about this important union of public humanities and CEL and the students’ work therein in Kenyon’s digital repository, and may I suggest a deeper dive to learn more about the <a href="http://www.kenyon.edu/middle-path/story/class-acts/">student-led implementation of a program</a> that will help Mt. Vernon Latino/a youth prepare for the college application process.</p>
<p>LiRA takes as its model a similar project by Kenyon professor Ric Shefield, the <a href="http://digital.kenyon.edu/knoxcobha/">Knox County Black History Archives</a>, digtized under the Ohio Five Libraries’ previous grant &quot;<a href="http://www.ohio5.org/portal/">Next Generation Library</a>.&quot; Both LiRA and the Black History Archives are imagined as a part of a unified series of similar local oral history projects that would fall under the banner of <em><a href="http://digital.kenyon.edu/thecommunitywithin/">The Community Within</a></em>. In the coming year, Sheffield plans to share the concept of <em>The Community Within</em> with other liberal arts colleges, providing a framework for local oral history projects.</p>
<p>To my mind, one of the great foundational principles of <em>The Community Within</em>, a principle exemplified by both LiRA and the Black History Archives, is the necessity of presenting the projects’ research in a material exhibition within the community itself, in this case the public library. Such a presentation not only ties a Kenyon College research project to the local community, but it also gets to the core of accessibility and digital projects. Indeed, the community-based research is the guiding force here; digital preservation and dissemination are peripheral (though important) concerns. As pedagogical enterprises, projects like LiRA ask students to go beyond the simple reporting of archival material – of known histories – and asks them instead to create and curate an alternative archive of underrepreented cultural material.</p>
<p><a href="http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/">Ohio Five Digital Scholarship</a> is grateful to have been able to play a part in LiRA and the Knox County Black Archive, but both have come about with the generous support of a number of people and agencies. The LiRA exhibit provides an extensive list of credits and acknowledgements – including Ohio Humanities, a state affiliate of the NEH – but I will take this opportunity to underline the contributions of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-nolt-64135829">Jenna Nolt</a>, Kenyon’s Digital Initiatives Librarian who has been creating these projects’ public faces in Kenyon’s digital repository.</p>
<p>What are some of the ways in which you are doing public and/or digital history with your liberal arts students? Let us know on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ohiofiveDS/">Facebook</a> or post a comment a below.</p>
