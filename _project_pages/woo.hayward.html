<p class="p1">This project will develop a new writing course, English 160: Writing Travel, with three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course will help students returning from off-campus study to integrate their off-campus experiences into the campus curriculum; </li>
<li>The course will increase students’ global awareness by first analyzing and then producing travel writing that interrogates the writer’s own identity while exploring the host country; </li>
<li>The course will harness social media and digital technology to create an audience for student work, mentoring the students as they write for and produce an online magazine to showcase their travel writing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course description:</h3>
<p class="p1">As a community of writers and travelers, we will explore what it means to travel, to come home, and to process the experience of new places, people, and ideas about the world. Through scaffolded reading and writing assignments, you will learn strategies for describing and shaping your experiences so that you can integrate them more fully into your larger personal and intellectual journeys.</p>
<p class="p1">Our primary focus in the first half of the course will be to examine the ways that other travel writers—both early and contemporary—have shaped their experiences so as to make them meaningful to others; at the same time, we will work on building your own experiences, mementos, and writing strategies so that you can communicate your travels effectively. In the second half of the course, we will focus primarily on strategies for shaping your individual memories, images, journal entries and other fragments of travel into a text that readers can comprehend, enjoy, and be inspired by.</p>
<p class="p1">An essential part of the student experience will be learning about and task-managing the editorial process, including publicity, layout, peer review, editing, and design of mechanisms for reader interaction and feedback.</p>
