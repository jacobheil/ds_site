Oberlin's Mudd Library rescently hosted the EdTech Winter Workshop for professional staff, organized by Albert Borroni and the Oberlin Center for Technology Enhanced Teaching (OCTET). Thirty or so members of the Oberlin community attended, representing divisions from around the campus: the Allen Memorial Art Museum, the Conservatory, the Audio Visual team, Cinema Studies, the arts, Center for Information Technology, and the Library.

Because I had to run off to the Mt. Vernon Public Library for the launch of an exhibit -- more on this in a subsequent post -- 

Dean Tim Elgren (Hamilton) Strategic planning should be built around the curiculum, not the other way around. Stressing the narrative of the pathway through Oberlin curriculum. How do we tell the story of liberal education? Defend (?) liberal education. What is Oberlin's curricular coherence? Goals of the college have been approved by faculty and are driving change, etc. Shaping ourselves to look like a small version of a major research institution no longer makes sense: OBE produces a number of PhDs, but the job opportuniites are no longer there for PhDs. The Major -- as a concept -- isn't necessarily enough anymore; what's it about the liberal education that makes "the major" the most beneficial, unique for UGs? 

The Oberlin experience is the thing that drives change, this was agreed upon and the curricular coherence initiative is in process. Conversations in advising will start to emphasize the whole picture: not fulfilling distribution requirements but with shaping a student's academic identity. 

Students are interested in interdisciplinary educational experiences. This is going to be realized by teaching theme-based cluster courses: various disciplinary expertise Studio C: convergeance... academic convergeance. This is conceived as an "incubator." There's a lot of opportunity here for Digital Humanities/ digital scholarship. The idea is that studetnts will pursue BIG IDEA topics such as Gender Identity, such as the post Fossil Fuel world. But these seem to be ripe for digital interventions: if we're trying to change the world then we might, say, start an Non-Profit, or a startup that involves humanists, social scientists, and computational scientists, etc. This is an opportunity to exenmplify how DH and LAC motives interface. 

Exemplary kind of gathering? Are you doing the same thing? Let us know!
