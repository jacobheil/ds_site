<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-983 alignleft" src="http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/facebook.thumb_.oh5cuff-150x150.png" alt="facebook.thumb.oh5cuff" width="150" height="150" />Mostly I just want to announce that we have a Facebook page, linked immediately above. If you know me, however, you will know that I often <s>overthink</s> very deliberately approach things. You will not be surprised to know that I’m drafting a longer email about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> I think Facebook can be useful to us as we try to collaborate across distances on consortial digital scholarship. So you can look for that. For now, though, I will again point you toward <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ohiofiveDS/">the Facebook page</a> and suggest that this be your <em>central hub for information about consortial digital scholarship and pedagogy</em>.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Like the Facebook page to stay up-to-date</strong>. I’ll post anything that seems pertinent that comes across my virtual desk. Some of these I’ll also post on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oh5digitalscholarship">the listerv</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Post your events.</strong> This is important. I cannot stay abreast of all that’s happening in #oh5ds that might be of interest to your colleagues in other places around the consortium: post them here. If you have a student working in Ed Tech or the Library who already does your social media, have <em>them</em> post the info.</li>
	<li><strong>Exhibit your achievements and projects.</strong> Also important. One of the primary concerns has been that we’re not aware of the kinds of work that’s happing in the library, in the classroom, or <a href="https://flic.kr/p/waAcYG">in our technology suites</a>. Share that here.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask your questions.</strong>
Okay, I don’t mean to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Penny">Henny Penny</a>, but this is also important. As the guy who’s talked to a great many of you, <em>please</em> don’t assume that you’re asking a question for which <em>everyone else</em> already has the answer. We have a wonderfully varied range of expertise: let’s take advantage of it. <strong>This is what sets us apart as a consortial community of liberal arts practitioners.</strong></li>
