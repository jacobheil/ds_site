OH5 Digital Scholarship [is on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ohiofiveDS/)! But I want to use the opportunity to talk a little about 

I consider myself lucky to have had opportunities to speak with a great many people working in digital scholarship and the way in which I talk about Ohio Five DS has evolved. In the early days of the grant, way back in 2013, I was talking about our efforts to build large-scale, consortial collaborations on digital projects. We have had some success with this. John Krygier's (OWU) project, [Engaging Columbus](http://engagingcolumbus.owu.edu/), included faculty from Denison and the Ohio State University, and Denison's [Baptists in Burma project](http://baptistsinburma.midwesternmissionaries.org/), a partnership with [Axis Maps](http://www.axismaps.com/) and a handful of groups with archival material on Baptist missionaries, shows the promise of becoming a consortial discovery tool for OH5 library collections. The latter of these examples is growing only through a very deliberate effort of a handful of librarians and technologists at the moment; it is, by its design, an experiment in collaboration at the level of superstructure just to see what such work looks like. In the case of the former, however, Engaging Columbus grew out of pre-established relationships with, for example, the GIS offices for the city of Columbus and faculty from area institutions. In other words, it grew organically, and if the goal of the grant is to learn how to build collaborative projects in the absence of grant funds, then we must think about how to encourage this kind of organic growth. 

*** note to self for further drafting *** 

Organic projects influence because we knew what we were up to.

A shift in the way I think: not about building (planning, staging, budgeting, etc) large projects, but about building up the community out of which those projecs can grow.
