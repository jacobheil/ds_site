####OH5 Digital Scholarship [is on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ohiofiveDS/)!

#####Mostly I just want to announce that we have a Facebook page, linked immediately above. If you know me, however, you will know that I often ~~overthink~~ very deliberately approach things. You will not be surprised to know that I'm drafting a longer email about ***why*** Facebook and ***how*** I think I can be useful to us as we try to collaborate across distances on consortial digital scholarship. So you can look for that.

#####For now, though, I will again point you toward [the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ohiofiveDS/) and suggest that this be your **central hub for information about consortial digital scholarship and pedagogy**. 
#####* Like the Facebook page to stay up-to-date.
I'll post anything that seems pertinent that comes across my virtual desk. Some of these I'll also post on [the listerv](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oh5digitalscholarship). 
#####* Post your events.
This is important. I cannot stay abreast of all that's happening in #oh5ds that might be of interest to your colleagues in other places around the consortium: post them here. If you have a student working in Ed Tech or the Library who already does your social media, have *them* post the info. 
#####* Exhibit your achievements and projects.
Also important. One of the primary concerns has been that we're not aware of the kinds of work that's happing in the library, in the classroom, or [in our technology suites](https://flic.kr/p/waAcYG). Share that here.
#####* Ask your questions.
Okay, I don't mean to be [Henny Penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Penny), but this is also important. As the guy who's talked to a great many of you, *please* don't assume that you're asking a question for which *everyone else* already has the answer. We have a wonderfully varied range of expertise: let's take advantage of it. **This is what sets us apart as a consortial community of liberal arts practitioners.**
