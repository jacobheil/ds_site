Last Wednesday I attended the second of four exhibit launches for Kenyon professor Clara Roman-Odio's public humanities project, *Latinos in Rural America* [(LiRA)](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/exhibit-information/). The material exhibit, currently in the Mt. Vernon Public Library, also has [a digital component](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/) that is held in Kenyon's digital repository. As we read in the brief introduction to the project's digital component, 

> This project pursues the goal of providing an intimate window into the lives, origins and aspirations of Latinos in Knox County, home to Kenyon College.
