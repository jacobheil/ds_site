Last Wednesday I attended the second of four exhibit launches for Kenyon professor Clara Roman-Odio's public humanities project, *Latinos in Rural America* [(LiRA)](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/exhibit-information/). The material exhibit, currently in the Mt. Vernon Public Library, also has [a digital component](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/) that is held in Kenyon's digital repository. As we read in the brief introduction to the project's digital component, 

> This project pursues the goal of providing an intimate window into the lives, origins and aspirations of Latinos in Knox County, home to Kenyon College. 

The exhibit in Mt. Vernon follows the project's initial unveiling at Kenyon College and will be succeeded by exhibits at the Ohio State University (9-23 February) and Miami of Ohio (30 March - 12 April). [text](http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LiRA-Poster.jpg)
