Last Wednesday I attended the second of four exhibit launches for Kenyon professor Clara Roman-Odio's public humanities project, *Latinos in Rural America* [(LiRA)](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/exhibit-information/). The material exhibit, currently in the Mt. Vernon Public Library, also has [a digital component](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/latinoa-studies/lira/) that is held in Kenyon's digital repository. As we read in the brief introduction to the project's digital component, 

> This project pursues the goal of providing an intimate window into the lives, origins and aspirations of Latinos in Knox County, home to Kenyon College. 

The exhibit in Mt. Vernon follows the project's initial unveiling in December at Kenyon College and will be succeeded by exhibits at the Ohio State University (9-23 February) and Miami of Ohio (30 March - 12 April). See [the event flyer](http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LiRA-Poster.jpg "LiRA Poster") for more details. 

LiRA takes as its model a similar project by Kenyon professor Ric Shefield, the [Knox County Black History Archives](http://digital.kenyon.edu/knoxcobha/). Both LiRA and the Black History Archives are imagined as a part of a unified series of similar local oral history projects that would fall under the banner of ["The Community Within."](http://digital.kenyon.edu/thecommunitywithin/) In the coming year, Sheffield plans to share the concept of "Community Within" with other liberal arts colleges, providing a framework for local oral history projects. 

To my mind, one of the great foundational principles of The Community Within, a principle exemplified by both LiRA and the Black History Archives, is that the research undertaken for the project is presented in a material exhibition within the community itself, in this case the public library, even as it is disseminated and preserved in a digital medium. As Roman-Odio framed it in her remarks, the community members are at the heart of such projects, and the narratives that are revealed and interwoven by the project belong to them. 

Projects like LiRA are exemplary, as well, of the ways in which our students might interact with local communities in meaningful ways. As pedagogical enterprises, such projects ask students to go beyond the simple reporting of archival material -- of known histories -- and asks them instead to curate an alternative archive of heretofore unsynthesized material. 

[Ohio Five Digital Scholarship](http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/) is grateful to have been able to play a part in LiRA and the Knox County Black Archive, but both have come about with a generous support of a number of people and agencies. The LiRA exhibit provides an extensive list of credits and acknowledgement, but I will take this opportunity to underline the contributions of [Jenna Nolt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-nolt-64135829), Kenyon's Digital Initiatives Librarian.
